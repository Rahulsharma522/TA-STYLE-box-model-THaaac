### Create a web page with the following characteristics:

1. Heading element(h1) should be at the top of the page.
2. After the heading, there should be a paragraph.
3. After the paragraph add an image having all the corner rounded.
4. Below the image, there should be a circle with red background.
5. At the bottom of the page, there must be a footer containing few links.
6. The H1 has 1px red solid borders, background color #D18C1D, and 10px of space between the content and the border (padding)
7. The paragraph is contained in 600px by 400px boxes with 2px black dotted borders and background color #D1D631

                The margin area, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border area to include an empty area used to separate 
                the element from its neighbors. Its dimensions are the margin-box width and the margin-box height.
                The content area, bounded by the content edge, contains the "real" content of the element, such as text, an image, or a video player. Its dimensions are the content width (or content-box width) and the
                 content height (or content-box height). It often has a background color or background image.
